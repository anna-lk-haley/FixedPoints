This is a parallelizable fixed points code written in Python by Anna Haley, adapted from the original Matlab code from the Torino lab.

You could rewrite this to use mulptiprocessing or similar, but using the attached sbatch script may be a better idea.

To run this, you will require some dependencies - will add later.
